# Simple-Pos-Tagging

Developed a BILSTM model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, using a modified Brown corpus as training data. To simplify the problem, we will use a tagset which is composed of 11 tags. i.e. Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition, Determiner, Number, Punctuation and Other. User can enter their own sentences to get its POS tags.
